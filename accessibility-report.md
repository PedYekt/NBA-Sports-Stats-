# Accessibility Report - NBA Stats Tracker #

This file contains justifications for the project's adherence to the Principles of Universal Design as well as a statement about who the program might be marketed towards.

## Principles of Universal Design ##

### 1. Equitable Use ###
- The application is designed to be accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities. The application is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy for users to navigate and access the information they need. With its main functionality being driven by buttons and search prompts, it is simple for anyone, regardless of ability, to obtain the information they desire.

### 2. Flexibility in Use ###
- The application is designed to be flexible and adaptable to the needs of all users.  However, it could be improved in regards to customizability. There aren't any options to bold text or to change the font size, which could be beneficial for users with visual impairments. This is an area for improvement for the program to improve accomodation.

### 3. Simple and Intuitive Use ###
- The application is designed to be simple and intuitive. The main menu is a simple panel with four buttons that each lead to their own application, and information is laid out in a manner that is easy to interpret. The only limitation would be that the app assumes knowledge of basketball stats - an improvement would be to include a legend somewhere within the menu to explain each stat in the context of basketball.

### 4. Perceptible Information ###
- The application is designed to present information in a clear and understandable manner. The application uses a simple layout with clear text and tables to present information. The only limitation would be that the app assumes knowledge of basketball stats - an improvement would be to include a legend somewhere within the menu to explain each stat in the context of basketball.

### 5. Tolerance for Error ###
- The application is designed to be tolerant of user error. It is structured such that programs are guaranteed to work, and should the use make an error, such as trying to compare two of the same team, then they will receive a clear prompt without jeopardizing the program's functionality.

### 6. Low Physical Effort ###
- The application is designed to be easy to use with minimal physical effort. The application is designed to be navigated with a mouse and keyboard, and the buttons are large and easy to click.

### 7. Size and Space for Approach and Use ###
- The application interface is designed such that all information is presented in a compact manner that is easy to interact with. There is minimal strain on the eyes or the brain - the app clearly presents stats in an efficient and user-friendly manner.

## Target Audience ##

This program would most likely be marketed towards basketball fans, but its ease of use and simplicity make it the perfect application for people of all backgrounds. The way that the interface is implemented most closely aligns with the social principle. It is designed to be user-friendly for as large of an audience as possible. There are no extremely advanced functions or tables such that one needs to have advanced basketball knowledge. Therefore, the app is intended for anyone to use, with no bias towards certain audiences or individuals with impairments.

The Program might be less likely to be used by elderly individuals. However, the app has aimed to compensate for typical issues such as visual and motor impairment by making it easy to access different menu screens and making content easy to read. We as developers assume that the app will be used by fellow basketball fans, but relational equity remains a priority by making the app as easy to use as possible so that we can encourage basketball and non-basketball fans alike to use the app.
